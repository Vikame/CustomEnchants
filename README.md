# CustomEnchants

A library used for creating custom enchants.

## Custom Enchantment Creation

To create a custom enchantment, you can either instantiate an instance of the CustomEnchant class or have a class extend CustomEnchant.
A CustomEnchant instance requires a name, maximum level, and the enchantment target. You can specify aliases for a CustomEnchant when creating a CustomEnchant for usage in the /enchant command.

## Built-in Custom Enchants

There are 3 built-in custom enchants, however they are VERY rough and would need polishing on a server by server basis.
